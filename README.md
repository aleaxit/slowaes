Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/slowaes

Native implementations (no binary code allowed!) of AES encoding/decoding in various interpreted
languages -- for when you need 100%-purely interpreted code, or for didactical purposes (to teach
about the internals of AES to people who only, or best, "speak" a given interpreted language).
